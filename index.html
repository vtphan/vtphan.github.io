			I am an Associate Professor and the Associate Chair of the <a href="http://memphis.edu/cs">Department of Computer Science</a>, at the <a href="http://memphis.edu">University of Memphis</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Here I am with Bob, the Buffalo, at the <a href="http://www.shelbyfarmspark.org">Shelby Farms Park</a>, circa 2019.

			Years ago, I went to <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu">Brandeis University</a> in Massachusetts, and graduated with a Bachelor degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. After that, I attended graduate school in New York and received a Ph.D. in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu">Stony Brook Univeristy</a>, under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/">Steven Skiena</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			I joint the University of Memphis in 2003.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I teach courses that explore problem solving strategies and methods for analyzing large datasets.  These include Algorithms, Bioinformatics Algorithms, Data Mining, and Data Science.
			</p>
			<p>
			My research interest lies in exploring techniques to analyze and understand large datasets, especially biological data.  Lately, as I developed tools to assist my teaching, I started looking into platforms, techniques and pedagogies that teach computational thinking and problem solving to novices.
